# Dedboxing
Box game video no game no video

A Boxing simulator.

Stats:

Strength: how hard you punch

Defense: how hard you take punch

Hit: How accurate you punch

Block: How often you block punch

Speed: How often you throw and avoid punch

Note that there's a (small) memory leak due to me not actually clearing anything, just don't create a bunch of 999 round matches without closing the app every so often.

TODO: Better pacing More balance maybe Art + modding support someday Sound someday
